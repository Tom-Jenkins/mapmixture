## mapmixture 1.1.2

* To comply with CRAN policy, the high resolution basemap originally distributed with mapmixture v1.1.1 has been replaced with the medium resolution basemap distributed with the `rnaturalearthdata` package, which `mapmixture` now imports as default for the `mapmixture()` function. See the `mapmixture` GitHub example page for the single line of code needed to import the high resolution basemap from the `rnaturalearthhires` package.
* Added extra arguments to customise scatter plot site divider lines.
* Minor updates to documentation.

## mapmixture 1.1.1

* First release on CRAN.
